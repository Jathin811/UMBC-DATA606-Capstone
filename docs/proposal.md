## Background

**What is it about?**  
The chosen topic is vehicular collisions, specifically analyzing a dataset that includes information about the date, time, location, contributing factors, and outcomes (injuries, fatalities) of these collisions. Vehicular collisions are events where two or more vehicles are involved in an accident, often resulting in varying degrees of damage, injuries, or even fatalities. Understanding the patterns, factors, and outcomes of these collisions is crucial for promoting road safety, improving traffic management, and implementing preventive measures.

**Why does it matter?**  
This project matters because it provides valuable insights into the dynamics of vehicular collisions. By analyzing the data, we can identify trends, contributing factors, and high-risk areas, ultimately contributing to the development of strategies to reduce accidents and enhance overall road safety.

**What are your research questions?**  
1. What are the temporal trends in vehicular collisions over the specified time period?
2. Which boroughs or zip codes exhibit the highest frequency of collisions?
3. Are there specific times of the day when collisions are more likely to occur?
4. What is the distribution of injuries and fatalities among persons, pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicle occupants?
5. What are the most common contributing factors to vehicular collisions?
6. Which types of vehicles are most frequently involved in collisions?
